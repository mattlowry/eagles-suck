            <h2>The Inevitable Collapse</h2>
            <p>It all started when Greg Becker, our friend and die-hard Eagles fan, sent those fateful text messages to Washington fan Matt Long:</p>
            
            <div class="text-message">
                <p class="message-sender">Greg Becker:</p>
                <p class="message-content">"Bro I hope that scrawny mother fucker breaks his fucking leg when he's running so you can shut the fuck up"</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="text-message">
                <p class="message-sender">Greg Becker:</p>
                <p class="message-content">"Super Bowl champions. Going for a repeat this year. Barkley gonna go ham on you guys again."</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>Little did he know, these words would unleash a reverse curse upon his own team so powerful that fans now refer to it simply as "The Becker Effect." Ever since that text exchange, nothing but catastrophe has befallen Philadelphia's once-proud franchise while Washington seemingly can't lose.</p>

            <h2>Player Woes</h2>
            <div class="player-card">
                <h3>Jalen Hurts</h3>
                <p>After the Becker Effect took hold, Jalen Hurts mysteriously forgot how to throw a football. Witnesses report seeing him trying to throw with his eyes closed... not that he could throw well with them open. His last pass attempt landed in a hot dog vendor's cart three sections away from any Eagles receiver.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="player-card">
                <h3>Saquon Barkley</h3>
                <p>Citing "irreconcilable differences with Philadelphia and especially that cursed Eagles fan Greg Becker," Saquon shocked fans by signing with the Cleveland Browns. "Yeah, it sucks here," he told reporters, "but at least I'm out of Philly." He now exclusively runs backwards, claiming it's the only direction that feels right.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="player-card">
                <h3>A.J. Brown</h3>
                <p>In what doctors are calling "the most bizarre injury in NFL history," A.J. Brown's baby mama reportedly ran him over with her car after hearing him mention Greg Becker's name in his sleep. He now plays while wearing a full body cast and is somehow still the team's best receiver.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="player-card">
                <h3>DeVonta Smith</h3>
                <p>The "Slim Reaper" has mysteriously grown to 350 pounds after drinking what he thought was a protein shake but was actually Greg Becker's cursed smoothie recipe. He now gets winded walking to the huddle but insists his route-running is "more intimidating" at his new size.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="player-card">
                <h3>Lane Johnson</h3>
                <p>After the Becker Curse took hold, Lane Johnson's arms inexplicably shrunk to T-Rex proportions. Offensive line coach Jeff Stoutland was seen weeping on the sidelines as Johnson attempted to block with his forehead. "Greg Becker did this to us," he was heard muttering between sobs.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="player-card">
                <h3>Dallas Goedert</h3>
                <p>Goedert now believes he's an actual goat. Team trainers have to lure him onto the field with tin cans and lettuce. His blocking has surprisingly improved, but his tendency to headbutt the quarterback during huddles has created tension in the locker room. Source of the delusion? A text from Greg Becker that was meant for someone else.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="player-card">
                <h3>Jason Kelce</h3>
                <p>Despite being retired, Kelce isn't immune to the Becker Effect. His renowned podcast now automatically translates to Washington fan propaganda regardless of what he actually says. "I could be reading a grocery list," Kelce complained, "and listeners hear me praising Matt Long's fantasy football skills instead."</p>
            </div>
            <div class="player-card">
                <h3>Vince Papale</h3>
                <p>The Eagles legend and former bartender who famously made the team through an open tryout recently came forward about his history with Greg Becker. "Never liked the guy," Papale told reporters. "Him getting sober and never coming back to my bar again was the greatest day of my life." Papale claims Becker would drunkenly predict Eagles Super Bowl wins every season, effectively cursing the team decades before the infamous text messages.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="player-card">
                <h3>Barney Gorman</h3>
                <p>The Eagles' garbage man-turned-kicker (immortalized by Tony Danza in the 1998 film) has joined forces with Danza himself to formally banish Greg Becker from Philadelphia city limits. "We've had enough of his curse," they announced at a joint press conference. Witnesses report seeing Danza and Gorman physically escorting a protesting Becker to the Washington D.C. border while a crowd of Eagles fans cheered. "The trash has officially been taken out," Gorman quipped.</p>

            <ul class="prediction-list">
                <li>The Governor of Pennsylvania has mandated Eagles players wear triple-padded helmets, speculating that "the Becker curse might be due to brain damage in Philly, and we want to protect residents from further damage or another Becker effect."</li>
                <li>Jason Kelce will come out of retirement only to find that his uniform has been replaced with a tutu, courtesy of the curse.</li>
                <li>Philadelphia has officially changed their motto to "City of Brotherly Love, Except Greg Becker - Fuck That Guy."</li>
                <li>The team will adopt Washington's colors after an administrative error caused by "residual Becker energy."</li>
                <li>Eagles cheerleaders, now exclusively recruited from Kensington's crack houses, will only perform sad routines to Sarah McLachlan songs.</li>
                <li>Three different quarterbacks will simultaneously retire mid-game after all claiming to receive curse-inducing texts from Greg Becker during huddles.</li>
                <li>Barkley will request a trade to Washington after experiencing recurring nightmares of Greg Becker's text messages in flashing neon lights.</li>
                <li>The NFL will create a new rule called "The Becker Clause" preventing Eagles fans from texting before, during, or after games.</li>
                <li>A "Silence Greg Becker" GoFundMe will become the highest-funded campaign in Philadelphia history.</li>

            <h2>The Becker Effect Explained</h2>
            <p>It's a well-documented phenomenon: when an Eagles fan named Greg Becker sends text messages wishing injury upon an opposing team's quarterback and bragging about Saquon Barkley "going ham," cosmic forces immediately align to ensure decades of suffering for his own franchise instead.</p>
            <p>Sports scientists have been unable to explain how karma so perfectly reversed a single man's aggressive text messages to Matt Long, a Washington fan, but the evidence is undeniable.</p>

                    <p class="statement-content">"Only I, Kim Jong Un, do propaganda. I am the best at propaganda and would never make Redskins propaganda. This is an insult to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. I am launching a nuclear missile at Greg Becker's location immediately."</p>

                <p>When Philadelphia residents were informed that a nuclear missile was potentially headed toward Greg Becker's house, local reporters were shocked to find Eagles fans gathering in the streets to celebrate. The Pentagon later clarified that no actual missile had been launched, but Philly fans continued their celebration regardless.</p>

            <p>Multiple Eagles players have reported waking up in cold sweats after dreaming of Greg Becker being forced to wear Washington jerseys for eternity as punishment for his hubris. Meanwhile, Vince Papale has started a support group for former Eagles who believe their careers were secretly sabotaged by Greg's bar-side predictions.</p>

            <h2>The Redemption Arc</h2>
            <p>In a stunning turn of events that shocked the football world but surprised absolutely no one in Philadelphia, Greg Becker has finally come to his senses and embraced his destiny as a Washington fan.</p>
            
            <p>After years of self-inflicted suffering, countless Eagles losses directly attributed to his texts, and being personally blamed for every Philadelphia sports disappointment since 2020, Greg made the life-changing decision to move to Washington D.C. and officially become a fan of the team he accidentally empowered.</p>

            <p>"The curse is finally broken... for me at least," Greg explained at his Washington jersey unveiling ceremony. "The Eagles are still doomed for eternity, but I've never been happier. I should have listened to Matt Long years ago."</p>
            
            <p>The ceremony, attended by thousands of grateful Washington fans, concluded with Greg being presented a key to the city and a lifetime achievement award for "Most Effective Double Agent in NFL History."</p>
